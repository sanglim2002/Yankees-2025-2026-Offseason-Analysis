## Phase 1: Ask

* **Business Task:** To conduct a comprehensive financial and statistical analysis of the 2025 Yankees, benchmarking payroll efficiency and on-field performance against a 5-10 year historical model of recent successful championship-winning teams. The final deliverable is a set of specific, cost-effective recommendations for free agents and trades to address the team's statistical imbalances.
* **Stakeholders:** Hal Steinbrenner (Owner), Brian Cashman (General Manager), Aaron Boone (Manager), and the Scouting Department.
* **Key-Guiding Questions:**
  1. **Financial Efficiency:** What is the Yankees' 2025 revenue-to-payroll percentage, and how does this ratio compare to the top teams?
  2. **Spending Effectiveness:** How did the key 2025 playoff teams (Milwaukee, Seattle, Los Angeles, Toronto) allocate their payroll (hitting vs. pitching, depth), and did that spending correlate with postseason success?
  3. **Statistical Benchmarking (Offense):** What offensive profiles have defined championship-winning teams over the last 5-10 years?
  4. **Statistical Benchmarking (Pitching):** What pitching and defensive profiles have defined championship-winning teams over the last 5-10 years?
  5. **Gap Analysis (Offense):** How did the 2025 Yankees' offense compare to this 10-year benchmark, especially in P/PA?
  6. **Gap Analysis (Pitching):** How did the 2025 Yankees' pitching staff compare to this 10-year benchmark in P/PA and K%?
  7. **2026 Financial Outlook:** How much payroll is coming off the books in 2026, and what is the projected luxury tax situation?
  8. **Targeted Acquisitions:** Which available free agents or trade targets are the most **cost-effective** solutions to fill these gaps, weighing both financial cost (salary) and asset cost (prospects)?

 ## Phase 2: Prepare
